        <h3>Problem Statement</h2>
        
        <p>Currently, subsurface scientific data collected by consultants during environmental investigations related to 
            York Region projects (e.g., water taking, capital planning, development review, road occupancy) resides in a 
            variety of locations, from filing cabinets, digital reports, to databases of Conservation Authorities and the 
            Province. The existing file structure lacks the capability to enable the SWP team to quickly identify consultant 
            reports and borehole logs via searching by areas of interest or key words. As a result, many reports added to the 
            reference library are never looked at again.</p>

        <p> <b>Ideal:</b> A single system managing all information provided by consultants related to boreholes. </p>
        <p> <b>Reality:</b> There are a variety of data formats (paper format, reports PDFs, etc) provided by consultants that are not well organized. </p>
        <p> <b>Consequences:</b> Data is not searchable and cannot be queried, therefore can potentially result in data loss. Future decision making will also not be informed. Furthermore, there is a risk of having to conduct intrusive exploratory work again to obtain redundant information </p>
        <p> <b>Proposal:</b> An application that makes viewing and querying data/reports of boreholes possible. </p>
